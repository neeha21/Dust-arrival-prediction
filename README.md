# Dust-arrival-prediction
 INTRODUCTION : 
 The main attributes that are known to contribute to dust storms are wind speed, temperature, air pressure, humidity and the type of surface.
 The new techniques such as manchine learning algorithms could asset in weather forecasting.
 Machine learning algorithms will help to devise a reliable way of predicting future dust events based on these old cases of dust events.
 This study examines the process of predicting and identifying dust storms by focusing on a random forest algorithm.

 PROBLEM STATEMENT :
 Dust storms have an impact in human life. Studies have stated that particle pollution such as dust impacts more people than any other pollutant because there is no safe threshold below which exposure to these 
 mixtures of inorganic and organic substances and chemicals don’t threaten health .Studies have explained that the mechanism for detecting the outbreak of dust storms is not yet completely understood and, 
 therefore, the methods for local dust storm prediction need further improvement.

 METHODOLOGY :
 We are going to collect the datasets of the previous year’s dust storm attacks to predict the future attacks using random forest algorithm
 We are going to collect the details about which place is effected more , how much area was effected , what are the aerosol index of that area by collecting the datasets of dust storms 
 We will collect the past year records of temperature at which the dust storms will effect and which seasons have more chances of getting duststorms .By the help of random forest algorithm we will get the accuracy of what factor have high chances of effecting duststorm

CONCLUSION :
we have summarized through an analysis of the research efforts on the application of machine learning to dust storms. This review hopes to motivate researchers to experiment with machine learning to solve related dust storm challenges on classification and predictions.
